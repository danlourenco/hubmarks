## Architecture

Following WXT's flat folder structure conventions:

```
📂 hubmarks/
   📁 .output/           # Build artifacts
   📁 .wxt/              # Generated TS config
   📁 assets/            # CSS, images, processed assets
   📁 components/        # Auto-imported React UI components
   📁 entrypoints/       # Extension entry points (popup, options, background)
   📁 hooks/             # Auto-imported React hooks
   📁 public/            # Static files copied as-is
   📁 utils/             # Auto-imported utility functions
   📄 wxt.config.ts      # Main WXT configuration
```

### Key Directories:
- **`entrypoints/`**: Contains popup, options, and background entry points
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components (auto-imported)
- **`hooks/`**: React hooks for state management and logic (auto-imported)
- **`utils/`**: GitHub API, bookmark management, sync logic (auto-imported)
